# Router Store

This project is a web application built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. It features event management functionalities, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting events.

---

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

### üì± Frontend

The frontend is a React application built with Vite. The main files are located in the `src/` directory, which includes:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components.
- **Pages**: Different pages of the application, such as the home page, event details, and more.
- **Actions**: Functions for handling user actions, such as deleting an event.
- **Loaders**: Functions for loading data for different routes.
- **UI**: Basic UI elements like input fields.

### üóÑÔ∏è Backend

The backend is a Node.js application using Express.js. The main files are in the `backend/` directory and include:

- **Routes**: API endpoints for handling event-related requests.
- **Data**: Data handling logic for interacting with the `events.json` file.
- **Util**: Utility functions for validation and error handling.
